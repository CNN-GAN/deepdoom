# deepdoom
Learning dynamics project : playing doom with deep &amp; recurrent reinforcement learning. 

Implementation of ["Playing FPS Games With Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Lample & Chaplot, 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05521)

Please note that this implementation is not exactly flawless - have a look at [our report](https://github.com/fhennecker/deepdoom/blob/master/report/report.pdf) for a more detailed analysis.

## Requirements
The project is implemented in Python 3 and requires the following packages :

    tensorflow==0.12.0rc1
    vizdoom==1.1.0rc1
    scipy==0.18.1

Vizdoom and tensorflow might be a bit painful to install so feel free to have a look at their doc! :)
